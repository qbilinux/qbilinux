Tcl object-oriented extension [incr Tcl]
&
[incr Tcl] is an object-oriented extension of the Tcl language.
It was created to support more structured programming in Tcl.
Tcl scripts that grow beyond a few thousand lines become extremely
difficult to maintain.  This is because the building blocks of
vanilla Tcl are procedures and global variables, and all of these
building blocks must reside in a single global namespace.  There
is no support for protection or encapsulation.
