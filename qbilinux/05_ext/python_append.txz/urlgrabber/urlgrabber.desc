A high-level cross-protocol url-grabber
&
urlgrabber is a pure python package that drastically simplifies the
fetching of files.  It is designed to be used in programs that need
common (but not necessarily simple) url-fetching features.  It is
extremely simple to drop into an existing program and provides a clean
interface to protocol-independant file-access.  Best of all,
urlgrabber takes care of all those pesky file-fetching details, and
lets you focus on whatever it is that your program is written to do!
